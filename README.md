# Part II Project Template

A simple starting point for the dissertation for the (part II project)[https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/teaching/part-ii/projects] for Computer Science students at the University of Cambridge.

## Usage
To use this template for your report, either:
- If using a desktop LaTex editor, download the source code as a zip and begin editing! Alternatively, fork this repository and then clone your forked repository locally to your machine.
- If using Overleaf, simply fork the repository, rename the project, and import the forked repository into your GitHub.

## Contributing
There's a few small custom commands that I'd like to add (to be added as Issues in due course), but feel free to create a pull request or create your own issues for potential improvements. The template is meant to be minimal rather than comprehensively demonstrate every LaTex command, students can find plenty of help online for this.
